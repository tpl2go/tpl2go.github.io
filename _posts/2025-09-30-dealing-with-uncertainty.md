As a research engineer developing new technologies to solve end-users' problems, I learnt that defining the problem statement is just as important as designing and developing a technically excellent solution. 
Many of us in the R&D field have seen projects that are "hammer looking for a nail". 
To be fair, such projects are still important from a research perspective --- to understand the limits of a technique in a new scenario as well as building up the engineer's personal mastery of the technique. 
But we should accept that if after sufficient pitching, the customer does not think that the project offers sufficient value over the status quo, the project should be archived and manpower effort is better spent on other projects that would yield impact.

But what happens if the nail is well-defined with strong customer demand (with financial commitment as well), but we do not know what the hammer should look like? 
A modern example: developing artificial general intelligence. 
Or a more futuristic example: A quantum computer that can break encryption.
How do we know how to proceed in such scenarios?

This was a quandary I recently faced. 
As a tech lead, I had to make a decision on the research and development approach. 
Not making a decision  was not an option. 
But making a wrong decision had huge negative consequences too. 
It would suck for a junior engineer to spend his 1-2 years of his time trying to develop something which ultimately yields no fruit.
It would suck for the manager as well as he / she would have an unhappy staff to deal with.

I dont have a simple answer. But for now this is how I would act

1. **Start from theory**. Check for theoretical limits and potentials
2. **Survey widely**. Often we are not the only team who is interested in such a problem
3.
