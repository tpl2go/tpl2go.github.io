After studying the standard few digital modulation types like PSK, QAM, APSK, I would think that we have enumerated all possible modulation types. What other modulation types could there be given that QAM / APSK already exploits the amplitude and phase of a signal? Yes, FSK encodes information into the frequency but frequency is just a derivative of the phase and I could generate an FSK-like signal within the PSK regime. Besides, FSK is a pretty inefficient modulation type so let's not consider it. 

Well, you could bring up OFDM. But after studying OFDM I sometimes think of it as simply as a concurrent transmission of multiple PSK/QAM streams at different frequencies. Multi-frequency communications systems existed for a long time and OFDM could be seen as an optimal way to pack many channels tightly together. So while OFDM is indeed a new modulation type with many interesting mathematical properties and designs, I sometimes think of it as a smart trick or improvement over multi-channel waveforms than an standalone novel modulation.

But my stagnant view of the waveform design landscape was broken when I notice the developments in 6G.
